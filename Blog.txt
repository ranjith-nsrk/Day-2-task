Write a blog on the differance between document & window objects:

1.The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for HTML and XML documents, while the Window object represents a window in a browser. Understanding the difference between these two objects is crucial for web development and is an essential aspect of the client-side scripting language JavaScript.

2.The Document object represents the structure of a web page and its contents, and is used to access, manipulate, and change the content, structure, and style of a web page. It is an object-oriented representation of an HTML or XML document, and its properties and methods allow developers to access and modify the contents of a web page, including HTML elements, attributes, and styles.

3.On the other hand, the Window object represents an open window in a browser. It provides access to the properties and methods of the window, including the document object, which represents the web page displayed in the window. The Window object also provides access to the browser's navigation, history, and location information, as well as the browser's status bar, toolbars, and scrollbars.

4.In JavaScript, the Document object is a property of the Window object, which means that it can be accessed using the window.document syntax. This allows developers to manipulate the contents of a web page using JavaScript, for example, to change the text of a headline, add or remove an element from the page, or modify the style of an element.

5.In conclusion, the Document and Window objects are fundamental to web development, and a solid understanding of their properties and methods is essential for creating dynamic and interactive web pages. Whether you are a beginner or an experienced web developer, understanding the difference between these two objects and how they work together is a critical aspect of web development
